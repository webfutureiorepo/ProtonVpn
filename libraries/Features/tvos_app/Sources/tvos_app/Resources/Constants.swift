        through the ProtonVPN App is described in the Proton Privacy Policy
        (https://proton.me/legal/privacy).
        Your use of the ProtonVPN App is submitted to the acceptance of the Proton
        Terms of Service (https://proton.me/legal/terms). In this agreement, the term
        "Services" shall have the same meaning as under Proton Terms and Conditions.

        1. Proton AG and you acknowledge that:
            a. Apple is not responsible for providing any maintenance and support services
            with respect to the ProtonVPN App, as specified herein, or as required under
            applicable law;
            b. Apple is not responsible for addressing any of your claims or claims from
            third parties relating to the ProtonVPN App, including (i) product liability
            claims; (ii) any claim that the ProtonVPN App fails to conform to any applicable
            legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer
            protection, privacy, or similar legislation;
            c. In the event of any third party claim that the ProtonVPN App or your use of
            the ProtonVPN App infringes that third party's intellectual property rights,
            Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and
            discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim;
            d. Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this License
            Agreement and that, upon you acceptance of the terms and conditions of this

        2. The ProtonVPN App is provided "as-is." Proton AG, its contributors, licensors,
        and distributors, disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including
        without limitation, warranties that the Services are merchantable and fit for
        your particular purposes. You bear the entire risk as to the ProtonVPN App for
        your purposes and as to the quality and performance of the ProtonVPN App.
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied
        warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.

        3. Except as required by law, Proton AG, its contributors, licensors, and
        distributors will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential,
        punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in any way relating to the use

        $500 (five hundred dollars). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
        limitation of certain damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to

        terms may not be modified or canceled without Proton AG's written agreement.

        its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these terms is held to be invalid or
        unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the
